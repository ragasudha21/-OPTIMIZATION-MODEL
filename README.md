DESCRIPTION:Task 4 of the CodTech Data Science Internship focuses on applying optimization techniques to solve a real-world business problem using Python. This task is designed to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, encouraging interns to use mathematical models and computational tools to make informed decisions in business scenarios. The primary objective is to understand how optimization can be used to achieve the best outcomes under given constraints—such as maximizing profits, minimizing costs, or efficiently allocating limited resources.

Objective:
The goal of Task 4 is to formulate and solve an optimization problem using Linear Programming (LP) or other suitable techniques, leveraging Python libraries such as PuLP, SciPy, or CVXPY. Interns are expected to translate a real-world scenario—such as production planning, resource allocation, transportation logistics, or investment portfolio optimization—into a mathematical model and solve it programmatically.

Tools and Libraries:
The task primarily recommends the use of the PuLP library, a user-friendly Python package for linear programming that allows users to define decision variables, objective functions, and constraints with ease. Other optional tools may include NumPy for calculations, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization of the results.

Expected Deliverables:
Interns are required to submit a Jupyter Notebook or Python script that includes:

A clearly defined business problem statement.

The mathematical formulation of the problem—identifying the decision variables, objective function (maximize/minimize), and constraints.

Python implementation using an optimization library like PuLP.

A solution section that interprets the output (e.g., optimal values of decision variables, maximum profit, minimum cost).

Insights and observations explaining how the solution helps solve the original business problem.

Example Use Case:
An example would be optimizing the product mix for a factory that produces two products, each requiring different resources (like labor and material) and generating different profit margins. Given constraints like limited labor hours and material availability, the intern must determine how many units of each product should be produced to maximize profit. This would be modeled using linear programming and solved using PuLP.

Learning Outcomes:
Through this task, interns will:

Gain practical exposure to mathematical modeling.

Learn how to define and implement constraints and objectives in Python.

Understand the real-world application of optimization techniques in various domains like manufacturing, supply chain, finance, and operations.

Improve problem-solving skills by converting qualitative business problems into quantitative models.

Final Notes:
The task reinforces key data science competencies such as mathematical reasoning, analytical thinking, and Python programming. Interns are encouraged to document their code properly, follow a clean structure in their notebooks, and include visualizations or graphs wherever applicable to enhance understanding. Upon successful completion and submission of this task—along with the other three tasks—a certificate of completion will be awarded by CodTech.

This task plays a crucial role in preparing interns for roles in data science, operations research, and analytics, where optimization is a core skill set.
